## Surface Plane - Color, Typography, Effect, and Images

Having diligently conducted extensive research, strategy formulation, and brainstorming sessions, we've meticulously sculpted a robust project blueprint. With this foundational layer established, we stand on the cusp of delving into the next phase: curating the surface plane. While this preparatory work is indispensable, it's during the tangible creation and coding phases that we expect to discern any potential intricacies or challenges. The moment has arrived to breathe life into our conceptions and refine them with every step forward. We're filled with eager anticipation as we watch our project flourish.

**Approach:**

Our project ethos draws inspiration from the insightful words of Nikola Tesla, who once articulated:

"My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get a new idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination, making improvements, and operating the device in my mind. When I have gone so far as to embody everything in my invention, every possible improvement I can think of, and when I see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form the final product of my brain."
 
Mirroring Tesla's practice of thorough mental refinement before actualization, we commit to rigorously orchestrating and refining our project ahead of its programming stage.

Currently, our focal point lies on the surface plane. This domain extends beyond mere interface design; it encapsulates the entirety of the user's interaction journey. We're driven by the ambition to instate a unified visual lexicon that orchestrates every interaction and touchpoint, ensuring a seamless and instinctual user experience.

Every detail, every nuance is pivotal to the project's triumph, and we are unwavering in our dedication to their perfection.

### Layout

#### Technologies Used

- Vendor templates as referenced in [Technologies Used](../../../tech/tech_used.md)
- Bootstrap
- Custom Code

#### Homepage

- On entry, users encounter an intuitive header with dropdowns and a search function. This is followed by a call-to-action section showcasing a video/image on the left, complemented by text on the right. An accompanying button invites users to explore Plexosoft Marketplace further.
  
- The Products & Services are sequentially displayed as: Product & Service (mixed cards), Product (Product cards), and Service (Service cards).

- Product & Service sections feature rows with 3 columns, each housing 3 cards (styled using Bootstrap). These cards provide key details and specific call-to-action instructions.

- Each card is subdivided into: card header, card body, and card footer, distinctively separated by unique borders.

- The footer is divided into three columns: About, Useful Links, Newsletter, and Contact Information. Preceding this is a subtle row of social media icons.

- All elements are responsively designed, adaptable to different screen sizes.

#### Login
