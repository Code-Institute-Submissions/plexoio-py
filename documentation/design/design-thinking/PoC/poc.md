Consistent with Plexosoft's project vision, we have embarked on crafting a Proof of Concept (PoC) deeply rooted in the principles garnered from design thinking research. This prototype will stand as a testament to our commitment to user-centric design. Moreover, it will act as a wellspring of inventive ideas for both current and future implementations, furnishing extensive documentation to address challenges.
