### Final word on this session
Using Darek Cabrera's measure of difficulty, our product complexity lies between Complicated and Complex. User variables can be unpredictable, thus:

1. **Financial Inclusion Matters:** To be globally accessible, especially in regions with internet connectivity.
2. **Filtering options:** Allow users to tailor their experiences for a more personalized and relevant journey.
3. **Cultural resonance:** The product should resonate with users' cultural values and aesthetics for a sense of purpose and pride.

Addressing challenges extends beyond just the technical. Understanding underlying concepts, logical thinking, sound design decisions, and considering legal and cultural ramifications are crucial. By integrating these facets, the product can better cater to its users, fostering an inclusive and user-centric atmosphere.
