## Create Comprehensive Online Documentation

### Best Software

While having a `README` on GitHub is standard for giving an overview of a project and basic instructions, many projects opt for more extensive documentation, especially if they're large or are intended for public or wide-scale internal use. 

Here are some popular options for creating more comprehensive online documentation:

1. **MkDocs**
    - **Description**: It's a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

**Is it industry standard?**

Yes, having detailed, user-friendly, and accessible online documentation is certainly an industry standard for sizable or user-facing projects. It ensures that users, developers, and collaborators can understand, utilize, and contribute to the project more effectively. 

Which tool or framework you should use largely depends on your needs, preferences, and the technologies you're familiar or comfortable with. If you're already in the JavaScript ecosystem, for instance, you might opt for Docusaurus or VuePress. If you're a Python developer, MkDocs or Sphinx might be more up your alley. And if you want a platform where everything is set up and maintained for you, GitBook is a solid choice.

### Quick Insight

All of the mentioned documentation tools support writing in Markdown, which is one of the reasons why they are popular choices for developers. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to write and read, making it a favorite for documentation.

Here's a brief recap:

1. **MkDocs**: Uses Markdown exclusively. This makes it easy to get started if you're already familiar with GitHub-flavored Markdown.

2. **Sphinx**: Originally designed for reStructuredText, but it can support Markdown with the help of an extension called `recommonmark`.

3. **Docusaurus**: Supports Markdown out of the box. It also allows you to integrate React components, which can be handy for interactive documentation.

4. **VuePress**: Primarily uses Markdown, with the capability to embed Vue components within your Markdown files, offering greater flexibility for interactive content.

5. **GitBook**: Allows you to write in Markdown. It also provides a user-friendly interface, which makes the writing experience smoother.

6. **Jekyll**: Uses Markdown by default, though it also supports other formats like Textile. When paired with GitHub Pages, it uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.

When choosing a tool, in addition to Markdown support, consider other features you might need (like search functionality, theming, or integrations) and the platform's ecosystem and community support.
