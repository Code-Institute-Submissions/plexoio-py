## NULL After User Deletion Solution

If you'd like to replace the `writer` ForeignKey field with a string after a user has been deleted, you can't do it directly within the existing database model because the `writer` field is specifically designed to be a ForeignKey linking to another model.

However, you can work around this limitation in various ways:

### Option 1: Create a `writer_name` field

You can add an additional field to the `Comment` model that stores the username as a string.

```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    writer = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    writer_name = models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True, blank=True)
    # ... other fields ...
```

Then use a signal to populate `writer_name` whenever a comment is saved:

```python
from django.db.models.signals import pre_save

@receiver(pre_save, sender=Comment)
def update_writer_name(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if instance.writer:
        instance.writer_name = instance.writer.username
```

Now you can display `writer_name` on the frontend, which will continue to exist even if `writer` is set to `NULL`.

### Option 2: Handle it at Query Time

If you don't want to change your data model, you can also resolve this issue at the time you query the data.

When fetching the comments, you could write a method that checks if `writer` is `NULL` and if so, replaces it with a default string.

For example, in your view:

```python
def fetch_comments():
    comments = Comment.objects.all()
    for comment in comments:
        comment.writer_name = comment.writer.username if comment.writer else 'Deleted User'
    return comments
```

### Option 3: Virtual Property in Django Model

You can also create a property method in your Django model that returns the username if available, or a default string otherwise:

```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    # ... fields ...

    @property
    def writer_name(self):
        return self.writer.username if self.writer else 'Deleted User'
```

**Logic and Sense:**

1. **Data Integrity**: Keeping the ForeignKey maintains relational integrity. We're extending the data model or augmenting it with additional logic rather than breaking its structure.
  
2. **Data Redundancy**: In Option 1, the `writer_name` provides a redundancy that allows us to keep track of the writer's name even if the actual UserProfile is deleted.

3. **Query-Time Processing**: Options 2 and 3 involve processing at the time of data retrieval, which doesn't involve any structural changes to the data model.

Each option has its pros and cons, and the best choice may depend on your specific needs and how you plan to utilize this data.
