## Sorting Using Lambda Function

In the code snippet:

```python
combined_list.sort(key=lambda item: float(item.price))
```

We use a lambda function to specify the sorting key for the `combined_list`. Let's break it down:

- `combined_list.sort(...)`: This is a method call to sort the `combined_list`. It arranges the elements in the list based on the criteria specified in the `key` parameter.

- `key=lambda item: float(item.price)`: Here, a lambda function is defined. A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. In this case, it takes one argument, which is referred to as `item`.

  - `item`: This is each element in the `combined_list`. The lambda function will be applied to each item in the list to determine its sorting value.

  - `float(item.price)`: Inside the lambda function, it takes the `price` attribute of each `item`, converts it to a floating-point number (assuming the price is stored as a string or another data type), and returns it.

So, in simple terms, this lambda function extracts the `price` attribute of each `item` and converts it to a floating-point number. Then, when the `combined_list` is sorted, it uses these floating-point numbers as the sorting key. This means that the items in the list will be sorted based on their prices in ascending order.

You can add more arguments to a lambda function by defining them within the parentheses following the lambda keyword. Here's the general syntax:

```python
lambda arg1, arg2, ... : expression
```

For example, if you want to sort items based on both their price and another attribute, you can define a lambda function like this:

```python
combined_list.sort(key=lambda item: (float(item.price), item.other_attribute))
```

In this example, the lambda function takes `item` as its argument and returns a tuple containing two values: the float conversion of `item.price` and the value of `item.other_attribute`. The `sort` function will use this tuple as the sorting key, considering both attributes when sorting the `combined_list`.

You can extend this pattern to include as many arguments as needed within the lambda function.

## Lambda Function with Multiple Expressions

In the code snippet:

```python
key=lambda item: (item.category.category_name.lower(), item.other_attribute.lower())
```

It's important to note that both `item.category.category_name.lower()` and `item.other_attribute.lower()` are part of a single expression.

In Python, a lambda function can theoretically contain multiple expressions. However, it's a common practice to combine these expressions into a single expression, often using tuples, lists, or other data structures, when multiple values need to be returned or processed together.

In this specific lambda function, the entire `(item.category.category_name.lower(), item.other_attribute.lower())` is considered one expression. This expression returns a tuple containing two values: the lowercased `category_name` attribute of the `item` and the lowercased `other_attribute` of the `item`. This resulting tuple is used as the sorting key by the `sort` function, allowing it to determine the order of items in the list based on these two attributes.
