## Skeleton Plane - Layout, Interaction and Relationship

Our meticulous approach to this project has been instrumental in building a captivating and insightful prototype. Every idea and requirement for this iteration was seamlessly integrated.

While we recognize that the final product might differ slightly, a prototype serves as an invaluable starting point. It becomes our primary reference, facilitating immediate visual feedback and rapid adjustments.

Our development trajectory has followed a logical sequence: **Strategy**, **Scope**, **Structure**, and we are now transitioning to the **Skeleton** phase.

Up to this point, our concepts might have existed in somewhat nebulous forms, perhaps as isolated sketches without a clear connection. Yet, during the **Skeleton** plane, the essence of our project becomes palpable. We gain a heightened perspective that allows us to see the project holistically, an advantage that proves invaluable during the coding phase.

In this stage, all **features**, **functionalities**, **interactive elements**, and **content layouts** are clearly delineated. The intricate weave of interconnected components, which we've painstakingly crafted, is evident.

For this plane, we've chosen to use **Adobe XD**, a tool with which the author is intimately familiar. It provides an exhaustive **wireframe** that streamlines our process, fostering efficient collaboration.

## Conclusion
- The user-friendly design coupled with straightforward navigation is immediately evident, placing every essential feature just a few clicks away from the user's objective. 

- `The hierarchy of content and functionalities is crystal clear: the Homepage comes first, complete with voting cards and supplementary information. Next, we have the dedicated Voting page, as anticipated. Subsequently, users have the option to either Login/Register or delve into the Support dropdown section.`

- `There's a deliberate flow from basic to more intricate/complex functionalities and layouts. As users journey through the website, they're given opportunities to learn naturally. We are deeply committed to ensuring users aren't overwhelmed. Our adherence to the principle of **progressive disclosure** ensures that while vital information is showcased, there's no subliminal persuasion nudging users to favor a particular cause.`

- Considerable time and resources were channeled into this plane before any coding began, all in the pursuit of meticulous planning.

- Our design decisions lean towards familiarity; everything is crafted intuitively, with a keen eye on user behaviors, standards, and conventions.

- We gave undivided attention to aspects such as keywords, unseen metadata, content hierarchies, and the organization of lists and forms. These elements shine through in our **desktop-based prototype/demo**.

Our overarching aim was simplicity, intuition, and consistency. Concurrently, we set the stage for our last plane by outlining core design attributes such as colors, shapes, and other pivotal design facets. We now pivot towards the **Surface plane**.
