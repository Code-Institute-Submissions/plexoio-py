## Structure Plane - Content, Priority, and Organization

This structure will assist us in building the project itself, whether it is for the skeleton, surface, database model, or code structure. It shows us where we can expect the information or interactions and may provide answers to the question of why, considering the priorities at all times.

At this point, we naturally address the difficulties faced by users. We have made it as simple as possible by implementing clear navigation and ensuring a proper separation of concerns.

**Color guide:**

- **Red:** Probably not included in the initial release.
- **Green:** Represents inheritance.

**Summary**

- Our **Gitmind** mind maps vividly illustrate the different state changes, from the homepage to the various features of the MVP app.

- As always, we have prioritized consistency, predictability, learnability, visibility, and feedback to ensure a positive user experience.

We have taken care to use familiar vocabulary for the different entries, selecting terms that are friendly, involving, or fulfilling, similar to our [Maslow's hierarchy](../../design-thinking/idea-outline/idea_outline.md/#maslows-hierarchy).

It is crucial to consider both **Interaction Experience Design (IXD)** and **Information Architecture Design (IAD)** to develop a comprehensive mental model of the product.

## Interactive Experience Design (IXD)
For more details on our **Interactive Experience Design (IXD)** for the **Plexosoft Marketplace**, please refer to the attached mind map.

In this initial iteration, we have gained a clear understanding of our **desires**, **requirements**, and the elements that are beneficial for us in implementation. The integration of **IXD** and **IAD** has provided us with the necessary components to work with, empowering us to achieve our objectives with this remarkable project. With this solid foundation in place, we can now proceed to the **Skeleton** plane and start building from this point forward.
