# User-Centric Design

This is the second step in building our MVP for Plexosoft's software marketplace. The first step, {==Design Thinking==}, helped identify and prioritize the real problems our application aims to solve. Now, we're shifting our focus to the journey of solving those issues, always keeping the principles of {==Agile Development==} at the forefront.

Please review each section to fully grasp how an idea evolved into a functional and problem-solving product.

??? question "What is User-Centric Design?"

    User-centric design, as articulated by Jesse James Garrett in "The Elements of User Experience," focuses on putting users at the core of the design process. This design approach emphasizes understanding users' needs, goals, and behaviors and then designing products or services that cater to these elements.

    In short, user-centric design is about creating products or services that offer a smooth, intuitive, and efficient user experience by focusing on the users and their needs throughout the design and development process.
