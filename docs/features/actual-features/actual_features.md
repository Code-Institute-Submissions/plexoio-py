# Actual Features Explained

We are extremely pleased with our accomplishments, particularly given initial concerns about time constraints due to personal reasons, as well as external challenges like government decisions and unexpected changes toward the end.

Reflecting on the project, it's clear that each feature offers room for enhancement and future development, thanks to its modular structure. This iteration introduces simplified design elements and includes all CRUD functionalities: creating products, services, and downloads (admin); reading frontend items (admin & user); updating items (admin); deleting accounts (users); and consistently providing appropriate feedback.
