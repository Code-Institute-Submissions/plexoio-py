### Final word on this session
We believe, using Darek Cabrera's measure of difficulty, that the product complexity can range from Complicated to Complex. As we can't control how users handle their variables, we need to consider:

1. **Option to make it worldwide or local:** The product should offer flexibility to cater both global and local needs, providing features that can be customized or adapted based on specific cultural contexts.
2. **Filtering options:** Implementing filtering options can allow users to tailor their experience according to their preferences and cultural sensitivities. This empowers users to control the content they engage with, ensuring a more personalized and relevant experience.
3. **Making things look more familiar, approachable, and less bureaucratic:** To instill a sense of purpose and pride among users, it is vital to design the product in a way that resonates with their cultural values and aesthetics. This can be achieved by using familiar concepts, language, and design elements.

Finding solutions goes beyond coding and technical aspects. It requires understanding the underlying concepts, applying logical thinking, making good design decisions, and considering the cultural implications of those choices. By incorporating these elements, the product can better address the needs and preferences of its users, promoting a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.
