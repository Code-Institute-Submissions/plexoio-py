### Facebook
We have created a Facebook page accessible from the main footer of the site. We plan to use it for our client base and potentially for paid ads in the future. After several releases and a consistent client base, we will explore organic social media marketing on Facebook and other social media networks when it's appropriate.

- To create a Facebook Page we have followed these steps:

### Content Marketing
For this iteration, we have chosen not to proceed with the blog or academy section.

### Email Marketing

For email marketing, we have implemented Mailchimp. We adapted the code they provided to our own in order to maintain the overall design consistency. We have also integrated Mailchimp's pop-up newsletter module.

The forms are unique because it triggers actions in both Mailchimp and our own code. We store the emails in Mailchimp and also back them up in our database for future use.

We collect these emails for our email marketing campaigns, where we plan to send offers and updates.

#### Newsletter

We have implemented a Mailchimp-based newsletter that appears in various locations: within our product and service instances, in the footer, and in a pop-up model that appears when users attempt to leave the page. As seen here:
