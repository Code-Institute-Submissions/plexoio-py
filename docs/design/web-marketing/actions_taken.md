### Facebook
We have created a Facebook page accessible from the main footer of the site. We plan to use it for our client base and potentially for paid ads in the future. After several releases and a consistent client base, we will explore organic social media marketing on Facebook and other social media networks when it's appropriate.

- To create a Facebook Page we have followed these steps:

### Content Marketing
For this iteration we chose not to proceed with the blog or academy section.

### Email Marketing

For email marketing we have implemented Mailchimp. We adapted the code they provided to our own to keep the consistency of the overall design. We have also implemented Mailchimp's pop up newsletter model.

This form is a bit special since it triggers both Mailchimp and our code, we store the emails on Mailchimp and in our database as well as a backup or for future use.
