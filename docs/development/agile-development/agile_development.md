Agile Development prioritizes adaptability and swift responses to changing requirements. By promoting close collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders, it ensures a clearer understanding of end-user needs. Frequent iterations and feedback loops result in a product that's more aligned with customer demands, often leading to higher satisfaction, improved quality, and faster time-to-market.

An agile approach was used before, during and after development. We have used:

- **User stories** and **Product Backlog**
- **Timeboxing** and **MoSCoW Prioritization**.

### User Stories

The user stories have undergone some modifications since their initial conception during the **user-centric design** phase at the **scope plane**. What follows is the finalized user story that guided our development process.

- In total there are **34** user stories and **176** Story Points.
<!-- - Only **24 must-have** user stories  -->
<!-- - Only **10 won't have** user stories  -->

### Product Backlog

These user stories have undergone several phases to arrive at their current iteration in this module. Their progression included:

- Starting from **Theme**, transitioning to **Epic**, followed by **Brief** and **User Story**.

Additionally, we adopted **Story Points** using a **modified Fibonacci sequence**, culminating in their **Complete** status.

Simultaneously, each user story was structured using a comprehensive template that captures essential data, metadata, progress logs, and developer comments.

### Timeboxing

Timeboxing in agile development involves allocating a fixed duration, termed "timebox", to a specific task. Regardless of whether the task is fully completed by the end of this period, the team proceeds to the next task. This methodology ensures consistent progress, on-time task management, and regular reprioritization.

To facilitate this approach, we employed Github's project boards within the projects section. This board segmented tasks into **Todo**, **In progress**, and **Done** categories, effectively assisting us in sprint creation.

This strategy was paramount to our development workflow. It championed organic and structured software development, while simultaneously emphasizing task prioritization and our predictive measures, as outlined in 'RELEASE: Estimation and Team Velocity'.

For an in-depth perspective, please refer to:

- [Project Boards (Sprints or Iterations)](https://github.com/plexoio/py/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
- [RELEASE: Estimation and Team Velocity](https://github.com/plexoio/py/issues/36)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

**MoSCoW Prioritization** in agile development is a technique used to prioritize requirements by categorizing them into:

- **Must have**: Essential requirements necessary for a successful release.
- **Should have**: Important but not vital; can be delayed if necessary.
- **Could have**: Desirable features that are beneficial but not essential.
- **Won't have**: Items agreed upon as not necessary for the current release but might be considered in the future.

This method helped us clarify and agree on priorities, ensuring that the most crucial features were delivered first.

We applied the **MoSCoW Prioritization** method as **labels** within our product backlog and during timeboxing. For a comprehensive overview of these labels in action, please visit:
