## Technical Testing

### HTML Validator

Many issues found and all were solved, Jinja templating language made it extremely hard at first.

### CSS Validator - W3C

No issues were found in our custom css at 'static/frontend/css/base.css'.

### JSHint (API by Code Institute)

No particular issues found in our custom JS files at:

- '/py/static/frontend/js/script.js'
- '/py/static/custom/js/script.js'

### Google Developer's Console

We meticulously reviewed every page of the site to identify any potential issues. We discovered a missing favicon.ico on both the admin and user dashboards.

- All issues have been resolved.

### CI Python Linter by Code Institute
Consistently adhering to PEP8 standards can be a tall order. For this reason, we frequently utilized the CI Python Linter throughout the development process. This tool proved invaluable in upholding code structure and enhancing the code's overall aesthetics.

At the development's conclusion, we performed another round with the CI Python Linter, ensuring everything was in order and implementing necessary adjustments.

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse offered comprehensive analysis across various aspects of our application. Although its use wasn't obligatory, we paired it with GT-Metrix to guarantee a high-quality product delivery. The outcomes were in line with our expectations.

### GTMetrix
Leveraging its distinct capabilities, GT-Metrix became an integral component of our testing regimen. It furnished us with invaluable recommendations, all of which were considered non-critical for this version. The app is performing optimally and is primed for release.

### Responsiveness

We tested our app across various screen sizes both during and after development. This seamless adaptability can be attributed to the capabilities of Bootstrap and the vendor templates we employed.

## Bugs

Like any project, ours has had its share of bugs. Below are some of the challenges we've faced:

#### a) Website Performance
We endeavored to consolidate everything using Django, Bootstrap, JQuery, PostgreSQL database and other technologies, aiming for a robust web application that functions seamlessly across all devices. However, we cannot assure consistent performance on devices with limited memory or processing capabilities.

#### b) Stripe Integration

We did no have any particular bug that would delay our project, however we encounter many times issues related to variable values, like secret keys, etc.

#### c) Social Media Links
At the moment, social media buttons direct users to the primary pages, intended solely for demonstration.

#### d) Features

There were some features such as the Like functionality that costed us a lot of time to figure out. At the end we opted for using AJAX and Json responses. All issues were solved.

#### Other Potential Bugs
For other issues, we suggest refreshing the page or clearing cache files. If problems persist, it's likely not an issue with the Plexosoft project but may pertain to third-party services or the specific settings and capabilities of your device.

## Security

Concise explanation of why Django, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL are considered safe:

### Plexosoft's system

1. **Django**:
   - **Framework Design**: Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy and provides built-in protection against many common security threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
   - **Secure Defaults**: By default, Django configurations are set to be secure, ensuring developers don't accidentally expose vulnerabilities.
   - **Regular Updates**: The Django team frequently releases updates and patches to address any identified security concerns.

2. **Bootstrap**:
   - **Sanitized Inputs**: Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins are designed to automatically sanitize inputs to protect against XSS attacks.
   - **Trusted Development**: Bootstrap is maintained by a dedicated team and has a large community that helps in identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Consistent Updates**: The Bootstrap team provides regular updates to keep the library secure against new threats.

3. **PostgreSQL**:
   - **Robust Access Controls**: PostgreSQL offers fine-grained access controls, allowing administrators to define who can access the database and what actions they can perform.
   - **SQL Injection Prevention**: PostgreSQL has built-in measures to prevent SQL injection attacks, especially when developers use parameterized queries.
   - **Encryption**: PostgreSQL supports data encryption both at rest and in transit, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.

All three tools prioritize security in their design and implementation. However, it's essential for us to stay updated with the latest versions and best practices to ensure maximum safety.

### Extra security & Accessibility

1. **`rel` attribute**: For links that lead to external websites (especially on a different domain), it's a good idea to add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the anchor tags. This ensures that the new page cannot access your `window` object via `window.opener`, and it doesn't leak referrer information to the new page. This is especially useful if you're linking to sites that you don't control.

2. **`target` attribute**: If you want the links to open in a new tab or window, add `target="_blank"` to the anchor tags. This, combined with the `rel` attribute mentioned above, is a common combination for external links.

3. **`aria-label` or `title` attribute**: To make your links more accessible, especially since they only contain icons and no text, you can use the `aria-label` attribute to describe the purpose of the link to screen readers. Alternatively, you can use the `title` attribute to provide a tooltip when users hover over the link.

We have applied them to all external linking:
