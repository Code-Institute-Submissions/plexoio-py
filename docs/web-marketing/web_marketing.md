## Plexosoft's Web Marketing

We have conducted extensive marketing research, enabling us to understand our target audience and establish clear objectives for continuous improvement.

Given the complexity of user preferences and paradigms, we have employed MoSCoW Prioritization to categorize our various options effectively.

As a new business with budget constraints, we have selected web marketing approaches that maximize our resources expenses and deliver optimal results. Our primary focus is on comprehending our personas' behaviors and driving meaningful conversions.

One underlying assumption, although not empirically validated, is that individuals prefer to discover an 'untapped resource' online. In essence, people may not be attracted to products or services that are widely known or overly exposed. Consequently, establishing an organic social media presence may not be advisable, particularly at the initial stages of our marketing plan and business development.

Another key consideration is our current operational capacity. Being fully visible in the market without the ability to handle a substantial volume of project requests or service offerings would not be strategic. Thus, an organic social media strategy does not align with our current capabilities.
